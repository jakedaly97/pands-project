## The Iris Dataset

The Iris dataset was first made popular by British biologist and statistician Ronald Fischer. In 1939, he produced a paper called *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems*, using the Iris dataset as an example of linear discriminant analysis. The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, consisting of a total of 3 species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes 4 variables: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all of which are measured in centimetres.

* **Sepal Length:** The length of the flowers sepal(the outer part of the flower that protects the bud during development).
* **Sepal Width:** The Width of the flowers sepal
* **Petal Length:** The length of the flowers petal(the colourful leaves of a flower, surrounds the reproductive parts).
* **Petal Width:** The width of the flowers petal.

The Iris dataset is popular amongst beginners in the field of data analytics, statistics, and machine learning due to its simplicity and clear distinction between the feautures of each species of Iris flower in the dataset.



## Code Description

1. **Importing Libraries:** The code starts by importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

2. **Loading Data:** The Iris dataset is loaded from a URL using pandas read_csv() function.

3. **Summary Statistics:** Summary statistics of the dataset are computed using describe() function and formatted into a table using the tabulate module. The table is then saved as a text file.

4. **Data Visualization:**

* Histograms are created for each variable in the dataset and saved as individual PNG files.
* Scatter plots are generated for each variable pair and displayed on a single pair plot, coloured by species and saved as a PNG file
* Two specific scatter plots (Sepal length vs Sepal width and Petal length vs Petal width) are generated with added regrression line to show correlation. Saved as seperate PNG files.
* A scatterplot of Sepal length vs Sepal width is generated using only Setosa species data with added regression line, saved as PNG file.
* Box plots and violin plots are created to visualize the distribution of each variable across different species, both saved as PNG files.

5. **Correlation Analysis:** A heatmap is generated to visualize the correlation between each pair of numeric variables.

6. **Machine Learning:**

* Data preprocessing: Label encoding is applied to convert categorical species labels into numerical values.
* The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
* Three machine learning models (Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree) are trained using the training data.
* Model performance is evaluated using cross-validation with 3 folds.
* The average scores of each model are calculated and saved into a .txt file.



## Discussion of Results

**Summary Statistics**
The summary statistics are the first pieces of data generated by the program, it gives basic statistical analysis of the variables found in the iris dataset such as the mean, standard deviation, the minimum values, and the maximum values. All these can be found in the summary.txt file that is generated. Some interesting results in the summary show that the petal length has the highest variablity out of all variables with a standard deviation of 1.77cm. The shortest petal length observed was 1cm while the highest observed was 6.9cm.

**Histograms**
Histograms are used to graphically show the distribution of the data. The frequency of a paticularly value can be easily seen and any outliers can be identified in the data.

species_histogram.png
Shows the frequency of each species of Iris flower measured in the data set. The histogram shows an even distribution with each bar reaching 50 on the y-axis. This shows that there is a total of 150 data counts with an even division over the three species found in the dataset.

sepal_length_histogram.png
Shows the frequency of Sepal length values across the data set. The histogram has a non-symmetric bimodal distribution. In the context of the iris data set, the histogram is showing a distinct separation between one of the species of iris flower. Sepal length could be a significant factor in distinguising one of the species from the data set.

sepal_width_histogram.png
Shows the frequency of Sepal width across the dataset. The histogram has a normal distribution, with one peak and a bell curve shape.

petal_length_histogram.png
Shows the frequency of Petal length across the dataset. The histogram shows a very clear non-symmetric bimodal distribution. There is definitely a clear distinction betweeen of the species of iris flower.

petal_width_histogram.png
Shows the frequency of Petal width across the dataset. Another non-symmetric bimodal distribution.

The histogram data shows that one of the species of iris flower is more easily distingushable by its physical features than the other two species.

**Scatterplots**
Scatterplots are useful graphical tools that allow trends and correlations in data to be found. Two variables are plotted against each other on an x and y axixs, any correlations between the two can be identified by how tightly the data points form a line. A line with a positve slope indicates a positive correlation, an even line idicates indicates no correlation, and a negative slope line indicates a negative correlation.

A pairplot of scatterplots was generated for each pair of variables. Then a scatterplot with regression lines fitted was generated for petal length vs petal width and sepal length vs sepal width. Finally, a scatterplot of sepal length vs sepal width was generated using only the setosa data.

There is a strong positive correlation between the petal length vs petal width across all three species of iris flowers. Setosa species typically feature short and narrow petals, while Versicolor species tend to have petals of average length and width. In contrast, the Virginica species is characterized by petals that are both long and wide. There is a very weak negative correlation between sepal length vs sepal width. The Setosa species typically exhibits wide sepals but short sepal length, while the Versicolor species generally displays average measurements for both sepal dimensions. Conversely, the Virginica species is known for its combination of small sepal width and large sepal length.

**Correlation Heatmap**
Correlation heatmaps offer a practical means of illustrating the calculated correlation coefficients among various pairs of variables. These coefficients quantify the degree of correlation between two variables using numerical values. A correlation coefficient of 1 signifies a perfect positive correlation, 0 denotes no correlation, and -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation. In the presented heatmap, the highest correlation coefficient recorded was 0.96, observed between petal length and petal width. Conversely, the weakest correlation was identified between sepal length and sepal width, with a correlation coefficient of -0.11.

**Boxplots & Violin Plots**
Boxplots and violin plots are useful for depicting the distribution of the dataset, they give a more refined view of the data than other graphing tools such as the hiostogram.

The Setosa species exhibits smaller and less evenly dispersed features in contrast to the other two species. Versicolor displays moderate distribution with average-sized features. In contrast, Virginica demonstrates highly dispersed features with a multitude of values. Each plot for each species distinctly portrays the mean and median values of various features like sepal length and width, as well as petal length and width, indicating considerable variation in feature distribution among the three species.


## Resources



## Get Started

To run this code, an up-to-date version of Python needs to be installed along with the required libraries mentioned in the code (pandas, numpy, tabulate, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn). *NOTE* There is a known bug with MATPLOTLIB version 3.8.0 that causes the correlation heat map to generate incorrectly (mentioned in the code comments). To fix this issue, MATPLOTLIB version 3.7.3 must be used instead.  Users can then download or clone the "pands-project" repository directly from GitHub. Users can then navigate the repository to where the python script is saved and simply run the command (python analysis.py).
