This project is submitted for the Programming and Scripting module of the course Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics.

## The Iris Dataset

The Iris dataset was first made popular by British biologist and statistician Ronald Fischer. In 1939, he produced a paper called The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems, using the Iris dataset as an example of linear discriminant analysis. The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, consisting of a total of 3 species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes 4 variables: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all of which are measured in centimetres.

* **Sepal Length:** The length of the flowers sepal(the outer part of the flower that protects the bud during development).
* **Sepal Width:** The Width of the flowers sepal
* **Petal Length:** The length of the flowers petal(the colourful leaves of a flower, surrounds the reproductive parts).
* **Petal Width:** The width of the flowers petal.

The Iris dataset is popular amongst beginners in the field of data analytics, statistics, and machine learning due to its simplicity and clear distinction between the feautures of each species of Iris flower in the dataset.
